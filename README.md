## Description

In the United States, there are on average 27 avalanche-related deaths per year and countless more avalanche-related injuries, and Utah is consistently in the top 4 states for avalanche-related deaths/injuries. Many backcountry skiers and snowboarders receive up-to-date avalanche information from the Utah Avalanche Center. The currently available information is in the form of crowd-sourced reports that users can view on the Utah Avalanche Website or mobile app. While this information is useful for safety, the way information is presented is largely text fields that don’t offer a lot of visual insights into likely avalanche danger.
Avyviz is an avalanche data visualization app that utilizes open-source avalanche data from the Utah Avalanche Center in order to help outdoor recreators make more informed decisions in the snowy mountains of Utah. Our team’s goal is to also allow users to download relevant information about their region to their device so that when they’re out in the backcountry where service is spotty or non-existent, they will still be able to access critical safety information.
